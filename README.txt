check.py -> string parsing script takes a string and returns all the numbers operated in some fashion, ie: x/10 or x*5

check2.py -> *** THIS IS THE ONLY CURRENTLY WORKING VERSION**** 
	backwards compatible with Python 2.6.6. Uses the os library instead of the subprocess library (which had replaced it in Python 3.5)

check3.py -> attempted to split string on every character, which then did math on numbers not needing math; this code does not work yet.
